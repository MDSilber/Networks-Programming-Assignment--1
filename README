This was the first programming assignment in my Networks class at
Columbia. The assignment was to create a collaborative drawing tool so
that multiple people could put shapes on a single canvas via a server
set up by the TAs. Not sure if the server is still running.

The assignment consisted of four parts. To see the assignment, open the
PDF.
